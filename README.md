## 🎯 Overview

LoraReact is a full-stack web application that combines the power of React with Vite for lightning-fast frontend development and a robust Node.js/Express backend for RESTful API services. The project is structured to run both frontend and backend from a single root directory, making development and deployment straightforward.

## ✨ Features

- **Modern React Frontend**: Built with Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **RESTful API Backend**: fastify.js server with organized route handling
- **Single Repository**: Unified codebase for both frontend and backend
- **Hot Reloading**: Instant updates during development
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
- **Easy Setup**: Simple installation and startup process

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18+** - Modern React with hooks
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend build tool
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Modern JavaScript features

### Backend
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime environment
- **fastify.js** - Fast, unopinionated web framework
- **RESTful API** - Standard HTTP methods and status codes

### Development Tools
- **npm** - Package manager
- **Hot Module Replacement** - Live reloading during development

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 16.0 or higher)
- **npm** (version 8.0 or higher)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

You can verify your installations by running:
```bash
node --version
npm --version
git --version
```

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AryaVaghela111/LoraReact.git
cd LoraReact
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies for both frontend and backend:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install dependencies for both the frontend and backend components.

## 💻 Usage

### Development Mode

To run the application in development mode, you'll need to start both the backend and frontend servers.

#### Start the Backend Server

In your first terminal, from the root directory:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend server will start and typically run on:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Environment**: Development
- **Hot Reload**: Enabled

#### Start the Frontend Development Server

In a second terminal, from the same root directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The React frontend will start and run on:
- **URL**: `http://localhost:5173`
- **Environment**: Development
- **Hot Module Replacement**: Enabled

### Production Build

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create optimized production builds for both frontend and backend.
